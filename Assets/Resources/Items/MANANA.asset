  description: Filipinos tend to procrastinate, putting off doing their jobs and
    studies in school. This also shows Filipinos being easily distracted, preferring
    things that they find amusing rather than doing their responsibilities. It can
    also be related to Filipinos often being tardy or absent from work or school.
